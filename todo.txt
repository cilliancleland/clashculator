Child Passport Identity and Consent Form
The Child Passport Identity and Consent Form must be signed by all guardians in the presence of an appropriate witness. You can find the list of witnesses on the form or at this link. Please print your cover page and form below.


Can't print now? No problem.
You can print the Child Passport Identity and Consent Form through a link in your confirmation email. This link is valid for 7 days from the receipt of the email and can only be accessed 5 times.
Please remember to check your junk mail.

Do not save the consent form to any public device as it contains your child's personal data.

Please provide the following documents:

Cover page
Child Passport Identity and Consent Form
If your childâ€™s passport book and/or card has more than 6 months validity remaining or if you are applying to change their name, you must submit the book and/or card to the Passport Service for cancellation. This does not apply if the book or card is lost or stolen.

Unless stated otherwise, original documents must be supplied. Please do not submit photocopies, short-form birth certificates, or laminated certificates. Certified translations are required if documents are not in the English or Irish language.

We will only start to process your child's application when we receive the documents listed above.

While we endeavour to provide the full list of documents required for your application, the Passport Service may request further documents if deemed necessary.
